    <string name="app_infodesc">\nDream Note is an app to help people organize their lives.
        Our application will be a set of productivity utilities, something like an "all in one".
        It has different features like: agenda, notepad, outlines, reminders, events, etc.\n
        \nEach of the features of our program will have a different section within the application
        so that you can navigate between them using a bar located at the bottom of the screen.\n
        \nThe idea came to us because nowadays online courses, due to the recent pandemic, have increased
        in popularity and more and more people are taking classes online. There are many people, especially
        students, who cannot concentrate due to all the distractions they have at home and in order to keep
        up with the pace of classes they need to organize their day to day. To achieve that, we want to create
        an app that encompasses different features so you can organize your ideas without having to download multiple apps.\n
